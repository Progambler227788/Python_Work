Hey! Warm Welcome o. Do you know the rules of the game? (yes/no): no
Yes, thanks for pressing yes. The rules are as follows below:

        Rules of Three in a Row:
        1. Each player rolls two dice. If the scores are in direct sequence, the lower number is doubled and added to the larger number. Otherwise, they are simply added together.
        2. If one score is greater than 12, the other player wins. If both scores are greater than 12 or both are 12, it's a draw.
        3. If scores are equal and less than 12, both throw one more die.
        4. If scores are unequal and less than 12, the higher score player can stick or roll one more die.
        5. If all three dice are in a row, the player wins automatically. Otherwise, scores are compared again.
        6. The final winner is determined by the highest score, or a draw is declared if scores are equal.
